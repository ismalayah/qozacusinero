It starts off describing how people tend to forget their worries when they are out having fun, forgetting the stressors they have in their life. However, the chorus of the song tells us that it is a put on, a facade. The repeat of the phrase "it's an eminence front" emphasizes how insincere and fake the party scene can be.</p><br><p>The song goes on to describe how people dress up to socialize and indulge in drinking while forgetting their problems, and how the news about the world and stock market crash can also disappear in light of the fun they are having. Finally, the song ends on a note to "dress to kill" to become a part of the facade that everyone is participating in.</p><br><p>Overall, "Eminence Front" is a critique of the entertainment industry and the facade that it puts up, where people can forget about their problems and indulge in the manufactured happiness that is presented to them.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean
