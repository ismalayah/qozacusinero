Therefore, in a new interview, he explains what he thinks about his A.P. Bio co-star Glenn Howerton; in particular, he feels he would make for an excellent member of the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Lantern Corps</a></strong>.</p><p>“There’s actually a character in the DC universe that would be perfect for him. It’s not the Hal Jordan Green Lantern…but the Guy Gardner Green&nbsp;Lantern. He would be amazing. The whole idea — so brilliant — and if they did it, they would have another Deadpool on their hands…the whole point of being the Green Lantern is that you have to be without fear and completely honest. That’s the only way you can wear the ring. Having no fear and being completely honest doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a good person.</p><p>So, the second Green Lantern is a guy named Guy Gardner — afraid of nothing and completely honest — like, ‘Oh hey, you gained some weight, dude’.</p><p>He doesn’t understand there’s things you shouldn’t do. He’s an awesome Green Lantern. He’s the best one because he truly doesn’t have any fear. Glenn would be amazing playing that. The Guardians of the Universe are like, ‘I don’t really know if we made the ring for this reason, but he is the best Green Lantern?’. So, that would be an amazing character to play.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/158515416174369896-2020-06-15T134340.027-670x336.jpg><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia veteran Howerton was famously James Gunn’s second choice to play Peter Quill in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Guardians of the Galaxy if Chris Pratt’s Parks and Recreation commitments got in the way, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and he’s been holding out hope of getting the call </a>to play another comic book favorite since.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=false><strong>Green Lantern </strong>is on the way back to our screens via an HBO Max exclusive series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but American Horror Story‘s Finn Wittrock has been cast as Guy Gardner</a>. Looking at the disconnect that’s run rampant throughout DC continuity since the franchise first launched in the summer of 2013, it can’t be ruled out that the Corps could make a return to the feature film realm, so the door might not be completely closed on making Patton and Howerton’s dream a reality just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJop5qspKS7brvSsJilrF2ptaq6yqxkoqyjYq6tw8CyqmarpaO7unnSrZirZaekwq2wjKaYpJ1dlnqxsdGfnJysXZy%2FprHNZqOapqSav697</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./state-and-main-2000.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>State and Main movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kunchacko-boban-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kunchacko Bobans biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heinrich-haarberg-age-everything-to-know-about-the-qb-for-nebraska-cornhuskers.html>Heinrich Haarberg Age: Everything To Know About The QB for Nebraska Cornhuskers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./infra-man-1976.html>Infra-man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rusty-schwimmer.html>Meet actress, Rusty Schwimmer from the Broken Trail</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bike-the-hennepin-canal-this-weekend.html>Bike the Hennepin Canal this weekend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-was-just-ready-to-cause-chaos-carrington-rodriguez-dishes-about-secret-alliance-with-ray-gantt-and-johnny-middlebrooks-during-love-island-games.html>I was just ready to cause chaos: Carrington Rodriguez dishes about secret alliance with Ray Ga</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncDash.
