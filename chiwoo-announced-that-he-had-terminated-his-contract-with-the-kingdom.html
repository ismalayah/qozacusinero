The following is an extract from the statement:</p><p>“We’d want to advise you of the Kingdom’s official stance on its future intentions.” This is to notify you that KINGDOM member CHIWOO has canceled his exclusive contract and departed from the group for personal reasons. We regret that the unexpected news has caused anxiety for many individuals, particularly fans.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=ko>[👑]</p><p>안녕하세요.

The statement mentioned “personal reasons” without going into more detail.&nbsp;Kingmakers were delighted about the new fan sign event and were told of the members’ Weverse activity a few hours before the reveal.</p><p>The fans were taken aback by the remark. Fans of the group started archiving the group’s youngest member’s postings in case the agency chose to erase them.&nbsp;Furthermore, the superstar shared a picture of himself with member JAHAN, as well as a message that said:</p><p>“My eyes sprang up early lol.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>last message on weverse and it had to be chiwoo. i can’t do this i really can’t <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ir0rZ6DBz2</a></p><p>— isse⁶ // thank you chiwoo 🤍 (@piwonchronicles) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 25, 2022</a></p><p>Because of the date of the post, supporters are particularly anxious about the contract termination.

The group undoubtedly had a remarkable and unusual debut in the K-pop business and was even placed first on RollingStone’s list of the Top 10 Best K-pop Debuts of 2021.&nbsp;The band will now be upgraded to six members: Dann, Arthur, Mujin, Louis, Ivan, and Jahan.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaGnpLxurc2npq6mk5qxbsDHmqtmoJVitaKwjK2cq6WZo661scNmn6KrXZi8r8DRmpqtZaeewal506GcZqOZo7Slu8xo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./review-little-dixie-delivers-a-brutal-throwback-to-the-old-school-of-violent-revenge-thrillers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Review: Little Dixie delivers a brutal throwback to the old school of violent revenge thriller</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./parents-of-vanessa-hudgens.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Parents of Vanessa Hudgens: Everything You Need to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heinrich-haarberg-age-everything-to-know-about-the-qb-for-nebraska-cornhuskers.html>Heinrich Haarberg Age: Everything To Know About The QB for Nebraska Cornhuskers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./infra-man-1976.html>Infra-man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rusty-schwimmer.html>Meet actress, Rusty Schwimmer from the Broken Trail</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bike-the-hennepin-canal-this-weekend.html>Bike the Hennepin Canal this weekend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-was-just-ready-to-cause-chaos-carrington-rodriguez-dishes-about-secret-alliance-with-ray-gantt-and-johnny-middlebrooks-during-love-island-games.html>I was just ready to cause chaos: Carrington Rodriguez dishes about secret alliance with Ray Ga</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncDash.
