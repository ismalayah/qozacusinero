Oliver Queen took to the streets of Starling City as Smallville drew to a close after 10 seasons. While Arrow only made it eight years, its legacy continued on. Developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg, Arrow took a different approach to superhero origins than Smallville’s slow-build prequel and passed that on to multiple spin-offs that drew on 80 years of DC Comic history.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Over a decade after Arrow’s premiere, the multiple series it spawned went on to span over 700 episodes and 42 seasons.&nbsp;While the Marvel Cinematic Universe was growing in movie theaters, DC’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowverse</a></strong> took over The CW to become the most consistent interconnected universe the brand has produced to this day.</p><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true>While it enjoyed great success in its formative years, the ending to the Arrowverse was rather anticlimactic. Some shows like The Flash and Supergirl were given a chance to bow out on their own terms, but others were not so lucky. Black Lightning, Legends of Tomorrow, and Batwoman were all cut short before they could see their stories through as Superman & Lois decided to go its own way and depart from the Arrowverse’s main continuity. In 2023, the conclusion of The Flash effectively laid the last nail in the television universe’s coffin, leaving a bittersweet taste in every fan’s mouth.</p><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=51 data-injectable=false>Here are the Arrowverse series in order of release:</p><ul data-current-count=457.5 data-injectable=true><li>Arrow (2012-2020)</li><li>The Flash (2014-2023)</li><li>Supergirl (2015-2021)</li><li>Vixen (web series, 2015-2016)</li><li>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow (2016-2022)</li><li>Freedom Fighters: The Ray (web series, 2017-2018)</li><li>Black Lightning (2018-2021)</li><li>Batwoman (2019-2022)</li><li>Superman and Lois (2021-present)</li></ul><h2 id=h-how-to-watch-the-arrowverse-in-order-of-continuity data-injectable=false>How to watch the Arrowverse in order of continuity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-CW-Arrowverse-Crisis-event-poster.jpg><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>If you’re after the full Arrowverse experience, you’ll need to approach it strategically. Buckle up: this viewing order won’t just take you forwards and backwards in time, but across multiple universes. Arrowverse series often ran parallel on The CW, with several crossovers acting as season highlights and pilots for forthcoming spin-offs. That means the shows are best watched in a particular rotation of episodes for the optimum viewing experience.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Some sites have produced detailed breakdowns of the 700+ episodes that allow you to watch them in a precise, if slightly exhausting way, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowversetracker</a>.

Another unforeseen crisis that shortened several seasons was the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Before the six-part crossover begins with the ninth episode of Supergirl, you should rotate Batwoman, Supergirl, Black Lightning, and The Flash up to their eighth episodes, introducing Arrow after two episodes of the other series.

While The Flash remained strong, Supergirl and Black Lightning finished in 2021. A new addition was the Supergirl spin-off Superman & Lois, but while the show’s first season keeps the question of its relationship to the larger Arrowverse ambiguous, in its second season it is confirmed Superman is the only superhero on Earth, thus confirming his is another iteration of the Clark Kent we had met in Supergirl, and making Superman & Lois a non-Arrowverse show.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>There’s no traditional crossover to think about, although there are plenty of cameos, particularly in the first five episodes of season seven of The Flash, as set out below.</p><p data-characters=28 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Essential crossover viewing:</p><ul data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true><li>The Flash 7.01, “Armageddon, Part 1”</li><li>The Flash 7.02, “Armageddon, Part 2”</li><li>The Flash 7.03, “Armageddon, Part 3”</li><li>The Flash 7.04, “Armageddon, Part 4”</li><li>The Flash 7.05, “Armageddon, Part 5”</li></ul><h2 data-injectable=false>Year 10</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Poison-Mary-The-CW-Batwoman.jpg><ul data-current-count=544.5 data-injectable=true><li>Legends of Tomorrow season 7</li><li>Batwoman season 3</li><li>The Flash season 8</li></ul><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>In 2022, as the Arrowverse reached its tenth anniversary, it also prepared to say goodbye. Internal business decisions regarding the rights to DC property and The CW’s content strategy changes, meant it was time to move on and, sadly, Legends of Tomorrow and Batwoman became the biggest victims of this situation. Both were canceled without the chance to conclude their storylines in a final season, and while seven seasons is a good run for Legends, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batwoman‘s three chapters felt frustratingly short</a>.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>From this point on, Superman & Lois also became optional viewing after decidedly breaking off from the rest of the continuity. The show was renewed for a second, third, and fourth season, which will be its last.
