Westbrook still had a blue strip across her nose as it heals from this latest procedure, and she tied her hair back with a black headband.</p><p>According to close sources, Danniella expected to see better results from her “life-changing” operation.</p><p>They said: “Danniella isn’t too happy with her surgery as it stands. Even though she’s not fully healed, she wants to go and get more work done. She wants to look the best she ever has and get her face right.”</p><p>To make matters worse, Danniella was admitted to hospital with complications shortly after arriving in Portugal from Turkey, where she had her surgery.</p><p>She said over the weekend: “The pain I’ve experienced is unreal, most frightening few days. Need it like a hole in the head, literally.”</p><p>Danniella – who had been planning the surgery for years – previously explained what she was having done in an exclusive interview with <i><a class=body-link href=#>The Sun</a></i>.</p><p>She said: “For the facial reconstruction, I had a surgical thread lift where they put 1200 threads into my face.</p><p>“Then I had liposuction to remove fat from my body and into my cheeks and lips to make my face more symmetrical.</p><p>“They also used it to align my nose. I had fat grafting on my chin and my jawline etched.”</p><p>She said afterwards she’d been left battered and bruised, explaining: “I looked like I’d gone 10 rounds with Tyson Fury.</p><p>“But the swelling has actually gone down really quickly. I’m already happy with the results.”</p><p>However, Danniella told fans the “frightening” pain stayed with her even after she jetted back to Albufeira in Portugal, where she is now based after quitting the UK.</p><p>The TV star’s septum famously collapsed due to sustained drug use at the height of her soap fame on <i>EastEnders</i>, where she played Sam Mitchell.</p><p>Danniella also has osteoporosis which has damaged bones in her cheeks and led to problems with her gums.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Because of her previous struggles with addiction, Danniella has only been allowed to take minimal amount of pain relief after the operation.</p><p>She said: “I literally take my antibiotic, ibuprofen and paracetamol – everything else I have is holistic. I use cream and arnica tablets. I can’t risk having anything with codeine in it because it’s cocaine based.”</p><p><i>This article originally appeared on <a class=body-link href=#>The Sun</a> and was reproduced with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmpJmbsnCvxKWcm6qZqcZuvMeoq6irX5mur7rInqOlmV2ssrTAwaumqKNdnLymv4ytpqmklajAbq3FrZyrZZaWsKqty2apnpufo8C1vtScq6KnnmLAtr7GnqmyZ56axLR50q2mq7FfZrKkfcKenXJxZGaBprLBbm5tamSYsHWxwZtwn25ombE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justice-league-also-apply-cgi-henry-cavills-hands.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Justice League Also Apply CGI To Henry Cavills Hands?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./state-and-main-2000.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>State and Main movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heinrich-haarberg-age-everything-to-know-about-the-qb-for-nebraska-cornhuskers.html>Heinrich Haarberg Age: Everything To Know About The QB for Nebraska Cornhuskers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./infra-man-1976.html>Infra-man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rusty-schwimmer.html>Meet actress, Rusty Schwimmer from the Broken Trail</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bike-the-hennepin-canal-this-weekend.html>Bike the Hennepin Canal this weekend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-was-just-ready-to-cause-chaos-carrington-rodriguez-dishes-about-secret-alliance-with-ray-gantt-and-johnny-middlebrooks-during-love-island-games.html>I was just ready to cause chaos: Carrington Rodriguez dishes about secret alliance with Ray Ga</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncDash.
