On the teen drama series, which ran from 2003 to 2012, the two actors played Lucas Scott and Brooke Davis, who were love interests on the show.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>After meeting on the series, Bush and Murray quickly began dating, before announcing their engagement in 2004. The couple married in April 2005, in a highly-publicized wedding ceremony that attracted significant press interest. At the time of their wedding, Bush and Murray were 22 and 23 years old, respectively.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=851 data-injectable=true>In September 2005, the couple publicly announced their separation, after just five months of marriage. The following year, Bush filed to annul their marriage, but her petition was denied, requiring the actress to dissolve the union through a divorce. The divorce was finalized in December 2006. Press speculation pointed towards an alleged affair between Murray and his House of Wax co-star Paris Hilton, but neither party addressed this rumor. Their published divorce papers cited “fraud” as the grounds for their separation.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Despite their off-screen split, Lucas and Brooke continued their romantic relationship on One Tree Hill, eventually breaking up several years after the actors who portrayed them. Speaking about their marriage on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch What Happens Live in 2014</a>, Bush stated, “We were two stupid kids who had no business being in a relationship in the first place. To all the other co-stars who’ve worked it out, more power to you.”</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Bush’s comments on WWHL attracted a lot of attention and were widely publicized. Speaking about the relationship again <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Armchair Expert</a> in 2018, the actress expressed her reluctance speaking about her former relationship.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>“If you’re in our job, for some reason, people wanna talk to you about like, when you’re fully-fledged adults who’ve done really amazing [expletive] with your lives, they wanna talk to you about the dumb thing you did in college basically.”</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Bush did, however, imply a dislike of her former husband. When pressed further about the marriage, she responded “My mother once said to me that if you don’t have anything nice to say, not to say anything at all.”</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>In another interview on Andy Cohen’s SiriusXM podcast that same year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bush went one step further</a> and alleged that she felt pressured into marrying her co-star. “It was not a thing I actually really wanted to do, but you know, it’s cool,” the actress stated.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>“When asked why she would walk down the aisle if she didn’t want to, the actress replied, “Because how do you let everybody down, and how do you — what’s the fight? And when you have bosses telling you that you’re the only person who gets a person to work on time, and 200 people either get to see their kids at night or they don’t because our days start on time?”</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Bush later apologized on Twitter, claiming her words were taken out of context and that her intent was humorous.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you’re taking the piss out of yourself – b/c people can’t let the past go & you really wish they would – & gossip rags try to turn it into inappropriate drama rather than self-deprication. Don’t twist people’s words, y’all. If it wasn’t clear, I was making fun of MYSELF.</p>— Sophia Bush (@SophiaBush) <a href=#>June 13, 2018</a></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>In a rare comment from Murray, the actor took offense to Bush’s words. This story is ludicrous. Chad conducts himself in a completely professional manner and would never marry for any reason but love,” a rep for the actor told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>. “Thirteen years since his divorce from Sophia, he has a very happy family life with his wife and children. He has completely moved on and doesn’t feel the need to engage in this type of behavior</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>Right after Bush’s podcast comments were released in the comments, the two former spouses seemed to indirectly post about one another on Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Do u know what I do every morning? Wake in my loving family’s embrace, make coffee & breakfast 4 the kiddos with my wife. Read 1-2 chapters in the Bible 2 start the day off right. Then we plan how 2 fill the day with love 4 my family & brethren. It’s so simple yet so fulfilling.</p>— Chad Michael Murray (@ChadMMurray) <a href=#>June 14, 2018</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you DON’T answer the question, you’re “clearly still bothered.” If you DO (barely) answer the question — while making fun of yourself btw — you “obviously can’t let it go.” Gee isn’t it fun being a lady?!</p><p>Can y’all be Elsa, and just let the ?s go.

So you do the math on my timeline.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TAsLzHophmmqWotW6tzZ1knKCRmXqutcKhmJ6kXaLCs77AsqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsGqucSloKedXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./devious-maids-season-4-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Devious Maids Season 4 Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ashton-kutcher-reese-witherspoon-2-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>See Ashton Kutcher And Reese Witherspoon Tease Their Netflix Rom-Com</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heinrich-haarberg-age-everything-to-know-about-the-qb-for-nebraska-cornhuskers.html>Heinrich Haarberg Age: Everything To Know About The QB for Nebraska Cornhuskers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./infra-man-1976.html>Infra-man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rusty-schwimmer.html>Meet actress, Rusty Schwimmer from the Broken Trail</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bike-the-hennepin-canal-this-weekend.html>Bike the Hennepin Canal this weekend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-was-just-ready-to-cause-chaos-carrington-rodriguez-dishes-about-secret-alliance-with-ray-gantt-and-johnny-middlebrooks-during-love-island-games.html>I was just ready to cause chaos: Carrington Rodriguez dishes about secret alliance with Ray Ga</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncDash.
