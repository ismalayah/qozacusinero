minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone last year.</p><p>This compares with 13 million in 2011, and the top five procedures were breast augmentation followed by liposuction, eyelid surgery, nose reshaping and facelifts.</p><p>The top five nonsurgical procedures were Botox (7.7m procedures), hyaluronic acid or soft tissue fillers, chemical peels, laser hair

most effective, most natural, most long-lasting and overall most cost-effective treatment for facial ageing remains a well performed cheek and necklift," the ASAPS report said.</p><p>It also foreshadowed a continuing increase in facial procedures by men, and the rise of "Baby Botox", targeted micro injections of a neurotoxin to achieve a more natural, subtle look.</p><p>"Generation Z, people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s will seek out aesthetic procedures earlier in life as a preventive measure and in non-surgical ways," ASAPS said.</p><p>Some plastic surgeons are willing
