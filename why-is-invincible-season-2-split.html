Enter <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Invincible</a></strong>, the animated series adapted from the critically acclaimed comic by Robert Kirkman.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Though the show follows high school student <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun)</a> as he learns to control his superpowers, this is far from a heroic journey. Mark learns that his father is actually a colonizer of worlds who believes humans should be subjugated. Season 1 ends in a knock-down drag-out fight between father and son as Nolan (J.K. Simmons) brutalizes Mark. Audiences were chomping at the bit to see the next chapter in the story, but they had to wait a long time.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>The first season aired in 2021, and it took two years for the follow-up of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Image Comics adaptation</a> to hit screens. But even when season 2 finally did air, it came with a caveat. Only the first four episodes were available. Season 2 was split into two parts, with the rest of the season airing in March 2024.</p><h2 id=h-why-does-season-2-of-invincible-have-two-parts data-injectable=false>Why does season 2 of Invincible have two parts?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Kirkman has some experience with leaving the audience wanting more. The comic book writer created the source material for one of AMC’s greatest achievements. The Walking Dead demonstrates the danger of humanity at the end of the world, all while leaving fans on devastating cliffhangers. Kirkman acknowledged this when speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a> about the decision to separate season 2 of Invincible into two parts.</p><p>“This is something that we’ve done with every season of The Walking Dead, and I think narratively, it’s kind of cool to have that pause to digest what you’ve just experienced.”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>But putting a division after only four episodes of content isn’t exactly the type of cliffhanger that fans were hoping for. While viewers had to wait to find out who was the victim of Negan’s (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) baseball bat, this trauma didn’t happen in the middle of the season. The cliffhanger was a cap on a season that had been building to a boiling point.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Narrative decisions aside, Kirkman admits there were other considerations to splitting a season fans had been waiting years to see. The primary reason why Invincible has had such a drawn-out hiatus had to do with elements behind the scenes.</p><p>“It’s a little bit of the production process just because ramping things up has taken a lot longer than we thought.”</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=false>While that seems like a significant understatement, viewers have to understand the work that goes into making an animated series. Many different creative mediums have to come together to create something of value. And Invincible is valuable. Fans keep coming back episode after episode to see the ramifications of the havoc that superpowered people wreak. The time between episodes may be long, but the series has quality to show for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmoKxlmaPDqrrCopmlnV2osqK%2Fzqdka2WjpbmqwI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruce-greenwood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruce Greenwood movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./survivor-contestant-zach-wurtenbergers-connection-to-big-brother-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Survivor contestant Zach Wurtenbergers connection to Big Brother, explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heinrich-haarberg-age-everything-to-know-about-the-qb-for-nebraska-cornhuskers.html>Heinrich Haarberg Age: Everything To Know About The QB for Nebraska Cornhuskers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./infra-man-1976.html>Infra-man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rusty-schwimmer.html>Meet actress, Rusty Schwimmer from the Broken Trail</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bike-the-hennepin-canal-this-weekend.html>Bike the Hennepin Canal this weekend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-was-just-ready-to-cause-chaos-carrington-rodriguez-dishes-about-secret-alliance-with-ray-gantt-and-johnny-middlebrooks-during-love-island-games.html>I was just ready to cause chaos: Carrington Rodriguez dishes about secret alliance with Ray Ga</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncDash.
