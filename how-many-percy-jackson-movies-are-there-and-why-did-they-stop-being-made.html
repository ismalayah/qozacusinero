And what better way to satisfy that little adrenaline bug than by reading a fantasy novel like The Maze Runner or <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Percy Jackson</a></strong>?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>While reading the book may temporarily fill that fantasy-shaped hole in our hearts, a film adaptation provides an opportunity to actually witness the events unfolding on screen, expanding beyond the limits of our imagination. So, when fans learned that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson</a> would finally receive an adaptation, everyone cheerfully jumped on board with the idea.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>That is, until they were met with a subpar adaptation and a mere two-film series. Everyone was hoping to see the next dystopian world come to life, but that couldn’t have been farther from the truth. Here’s why that happened.</p><h2 id=h-why-are-there-only-two-percy-jackson-movies data-injectable=false>Why are there only two Percy Jackson movies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/percy-jackson-the-olympians-the-lightning-thief.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Sadly, the franchise was set up to fail, and there are a few reasons why a sequel was never released. While the films weren’t necessarily box office busts, Riordan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has always opened up about his disappointment</a> regarding the adaptation of his books, admitting to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> that he had little creative control on set, and the films even went as far as removing five main characters.</p><p>“I certainly have nothing against the very talented actors. Not their fault. I’m just sorry they got dragged into that mess. To you guys, it’s a couple of hours’ entertainment. To me, it’s my life’s work going through a meat grinder, when I pleaded with them not to do it.”</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Riordan’s disapproval was also shared by the audience of fans who noticed all the unnecessary changes made to the plot. In general, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the audience became so unhappy with the discrepancies</a> that 20th Century Fox ultimately decided to scrap the franchise altogether after the second movie hit theaters.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Apart from the lackluster response from fans and even the author, the company acknowledged that if the films were to continue, there would likely be a significant disparity between the money invested and the money received. However, the films did earn the reputation that, even if they weren’t good adaptations, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they were a decent standalone series</a> but unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to keep the production afloat.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Good news comes to those who wait, however. Even though Chris Columbus’ franchise might have lost its battle with the box office, Disney Plus has announced an upcoming series adaptation entitled Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The company seems to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have learned from mistakes made in the past</a>, and with great excitement, the eight-episode first season is expected to premiere sometime in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaKur8WMqZyrm6lit6Kvyqymp2WdpMOqsdJmmKudXam1pr7EZpinnF2stbp5w6KbZqyYmsZuv9Oop2aalZ67qHnMmpueZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wayne-shorter-career-earnings-and-networth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wayne Shorter career earnings and networth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dateline-explores-shannon-melendi-murder-where-is-killer-butch-hinton-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dateline Explores Shannon Melendi Murder: Where Is Killer Butch Hinton Today?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heinrich-haarberg-age-everything-to-know-about-the-qb-for-nebraska-cornhuskers.html>Heinrich Haarberg Age: Everything To Know About The QB for Nebraska Cornhuskers</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./infra-man-1976.html>Infra-man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1976)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rusty-schwimmer.html>Meet actress, Rusty Schwimmer from the Broken Trail</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bike-the-hennepin-canal-this-weekend.html>Bike the Hennepin Canal this weekend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./i-was-just-ready-to-cause-chaos-carrington-rodriguez-dishes-about-secret-alliance-with-ray-gantt-and-johnny-middlebrooks-during-love-island-games.html>I was just ready to cause chaos: Carrington Rodriguez dishes about secret alliance with Ray Ga</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncDash.
